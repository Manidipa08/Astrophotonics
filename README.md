# Astrophotonics
This project was done as part of the coursework for Astrophotonics in Erasmus Mundus Master's in Astrophysics and Space Science(MASS) under the guidance of Prof. Frantz Martinache & Dr. Nick Cvetojevic. The objective of this project is to use the response of the 4x4 nulling interferometric recombiner to rebuild the complex response matrix of the device at the design wavelength.
